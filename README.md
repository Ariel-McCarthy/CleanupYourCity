## Overview
### Description
*This application allows users to be involved in keeping their city clean.* 
- A user can choose a location where they see some garbage or (like on 
the side of a road), give the location a danger rating from 1-4, and choose 
an icon(s) that show the type(s) of garbage present.
- A user can also see the locations that have already been marked as
having garbage, and can choose to adopt that garbage for points. Before 
choosing, they can also see the danger level and the potential contents of
the garbage.
- If for any reason the user can't adopt some particular garbage, they can 
still decide to withdraw their decision.
